				Hi!
				I'm a machine learning researcher interested in probabilistic approaches to
				natural language processing.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am about to receive my PhD from Cornell, advised by Sasha Rush.
				I started grad school at Harvard, also with Sasha.
        		Before that, I was a research engineer at Facebook AI Research.
            	I did my undergrad at UPenn CIS.
