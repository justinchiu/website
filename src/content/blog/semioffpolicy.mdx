In a previous blog post, I wrote a bit about one path towards [merging SFT and RL](https://justintchiu.com/blog/sftrl/).
That previous post relied on importance sampling, a method of approximating samples from a target distribution using an importance distribution.
But importance sampling is kind of a pain.
